## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:

- Only interact with accounts they own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate them
- Report findings promptly and allow reasonable time for remediation before disclosure

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve our protocol. Significant findings may be rewarded at our discretion.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
